# Java-Client-Server-Application

The aim of this documentation is to illustrate the concepts of Java multithreading and Java networking (socket programming) that were used to implement
this client / server application. Several players should compete against each other in a quiz. The game should be a pure command line application without
a graphical user interface. The inputs and outputs are made via the IDE.
